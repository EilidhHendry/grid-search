# grid-search-
5 hour challenge to write an algorithm which could find the least cost path through a grid. 
Implemented algorithm and began to implement basic django app.
Currently users can input their own grid then the results would be displayed on the same page. 

This was a challenge to see what could be done in 5 hours so app is still incomplete.
